# TwistMC Projects
Details from a selection of projects I've completed under commission for the Multiplayer Minecraft Network Server TwistMC. Code cannot be shared for obvious reasons.
TwistMC is a Minecraft Bedwars server. In the lobby of each game, the players vote on which 'Twist' to play with. Twists are new ideas of how the game could be played/tweaked, and I've been able to provide
a lot of these over the last 2/3 years. Below are examples of a few projects I've completed. If you'd like to try the server, the IP is TwistMC.net (we're in a maintenance stage at the moment so we've not often got many players on).

# Archer (Not yet released)
New bow items available to buy from the shop.
### Available Bows:
- Spleef Bow - Wherever the arrow travels it deletes the blocks it would hit in a 3x3 radius (excluding protected blocks).

# Defence
Buy bed defences from the shop, for varying amounts. Bed defences cannot be built normally with blocks so must be bought to have any kind of defense. Schematics are loaded in and placed around the bed.
### Defence Options:
- Bed Bed Defense - Styled like a big minecraft bed (8 Iron Ingots).
- Water Bed Defense - Lots of water (3 Gold Ingots).
- Lava Bed Defense - Lots of lava (5 Gold Ingots).
- Glass Bed Defense - Blast-proof glass (30 Iron Ingots).
- Big Bed Defense - Big Blockade (50 Iron Ingots).
- Sphere Bed Defense - Spherical with varied blocks (100 Iron Ingots).
- Annoying Bed Defense - Hard-to-break and varied layers of blocks (6 Emeralds).
- Largest Bed Defense - Massive woolen pyramid (50 Iron Ingots).
- Maze Bed Defense - Loads in one of 10 possible Bedrock mazes (Only way to get through is to complete the maze).
  

# Inverted
Custom shop is used to balance obvious issues (no blocks etc.), and each generator is swapped, so Iron and Gold generators now spawn Diamonds and Gold, and vice versa.
